# Hi, I’m Loomeh
I like building stuff that I think is cool. You might think it's not, and that's okay.
  
## Things I'm currently working on:
  - [LibreSplit](https://github.com/wins1ey/LibreSplit) - A speedrunning timer for Linux with auto splitting capabilities (memory reading).
  - [The Beat Revival](https://beatrevival.me) - A Mirror's Edge Catalyst server emulator project
  - [SpeedrunUtils](https://github.com/Loomeh/SpeedrunUtils) - A mod for Bomb Rush Cyberfunk that provides several QoL features for speedrunners such as auto splitting and macros.

## How to reach me:
  - Email: zane@loomeh.tech (Domain expiring soon, so keep notes on this.)
  - Discord: loomeh
